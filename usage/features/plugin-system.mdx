The plugin ecosystem of Cleek is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the Cleek assistant.

By utilizing plugins, Cleek assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.

In addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.

<Info>
  To help developers better participate in this ecosystem, we provide comprehensive development
  resources. This includes detailed component development documentation, a fully-featured software
  development kit (SDK), and template examples, all aimed at simplifying the development process and
  lowering the entry barrier for developers.
</Info>

<Warning>
  We welcome developers to utilize these resources, unleash their creativity, and write
  feature-rich, user-friendly plugins. Through collective efforts, we can continuously expand the
  functional boundaries of the chat application and explore a more intelligent and efficient
  creativity platform.
