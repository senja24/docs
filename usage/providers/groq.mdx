Groq's [LPU Inference Engine](https://wow.groq.com/news_press/groq-lpu-inference-engine-leads-in-first-independent-llm-benchmark/) has excelled in the latest independent Large Language Model (LLM) benchmark, redefining the standard for AI solutions with its remarkable speed and efficiency. By integrating Cleek with Groq Cloud, you can now easily leverage Groq's technology to accelerate the operation of large language models in Cleek.

<Note>
  Groq's LPU Inference Engine achieved a sustained speed of 300 tokens per second in internal benchmark tests, and according to benchmark tests by ArtificialAnalysis.ai, Groq outperformed other providers in terms of throughput (241 tokens per second) and total time to receive 100 output tokens (0.8 seconds).
